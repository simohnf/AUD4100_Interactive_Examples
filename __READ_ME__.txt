AUD4100 Audio Theory Interactive Examples
Simon Fay, SAE London, 2020

Latest Update: 08/09/20

These files are intended to provide interactive examples of key audio concepts. They are not intended to serve as tools for production or sound design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before opening these examples you will need to download and install the latest version of Pure Data (Vanilla) here:
https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data

These examples were created using Pd 0.50.2, although they should work with more recent versions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When PureData is installed and open go to:

Then make sure your audio diver is set correctly:
Media → Audio Settings...

Finally, you can go to:
Media → Test Audio and MIDI...

This will open a "patch" that allows you to test audio output.

Once PD is installed on your computer you will need to download the entire folder of resources here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SAXhCMmP_deOqjzsNbTictSJHNaLMf8b

Then simply unpack the zip folder and open one of the lessons:

Lesson 1 - AUD4100_1_SoundTheory.pd
Lesson 2 - AUD4100_2_Equalisation.pd
Lesson 3 - AUD4100_3_FX_Processing.pd

You can also open the file named “_AUD4100_LessonBrowser.pd” to browse all lessons

NOTE: Do not move/delete any files from the folders or the examples will not work!!!!!!
